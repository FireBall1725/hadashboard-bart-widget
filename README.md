# Bart dashing widget for hadashboard

The following is a widget I created for hadashboard by FlorianZ. More information on hadashboard can be found here: [https://github.com/FlorianZ/hadashboard](https://github.com/FlorianZ/hadashboard)

The widget is a 2x2 widget that shows you the how long until the next train and the train after that, it also includes the number of cars in the train.

# Setup
Copy the `widgets` and `jobs` folder into your hadashboard directory.

Edit the `bart.rb` to set your station and direction. I am using the free api key, but you can also change the api key to your own if you wish.

Add the widget to your dashboard
